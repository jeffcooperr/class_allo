CHUCK: Time rules over us without mercy. Not caring if we're healthy or ill, hungry or drunk. Russian, American, beings from Mars. This is the enemy we cannot kill. We can only try to get through the day. Tick, tick, tick.
CHUCK: Relentless. That is what time is. Relentless.
CHUCK: You need to slow down. Everybody slow down.
CHUCK: That's a nice watch. How much did that cost?
NIKOLAI: It was gift. From my wife.
CHUCK: Your wife has excellent taste. Now take it off.
NIKOLAI: What?
CHUCK: Take the watch off. We are now on Chuck's time. You're all on Chuck's time. Just think of me as a friend.
CHUCK: One, two, three. Go! Go! Go!
CHUCK: The FedEx clock never stops, never sleeps, there are no holidays, no weekends, no snow days.
CHUCK: We pick up and deliver packages. We deliver! Everything we do, every sort we make, every second counts. We live or we die by the clock. We never turn our back on it, and we never, ever allow ourselves the sin of losing track of time.
CHUCK: I'll be right back.
KELLY: Promise?
CHUCK: I'll be right back.
KELLY: I said promise.
CHUCK: I promise.
KELLY: Okay.
CHUCK: A package went through the Memphis hub at eleven nineteen PM. Memphis to Los Angeles to Moscow.
STAN: Chuck.
CHUCK: Yeah?
STAN: Try the shrimp. It's good.
CHUCK: Thanks, Stan.
CHUCK: I gotta go.
KELLY: You're kidding.
CHUCK: No. I gotta go to Malaysia.
KELLY: When?
CHUCK: Tonight.
KELLY: You just got here.
CHUCK: I know. I know.
KELLY: We were going to spend Christmas together.
CHUCK: I know. I know.
KELLY: What about tomorrow?
CHUCK: I'll be back. I promise.
KELLY: You always say that.
CHUCK: Kelly. You know I'll be back.
KELLY: I know you think you will.
CHUCK: I will be back.
KELLY: This is our time.
CHUCK: I know.
KELLY: We never get any time.
CHUCK: I know.
KELLY: If only time would stand still.
CHUCK: But it won't.
KELLY: No, it won't. Go. Be careful.
CHUCK: I love you.
KELLY: I love you too.
KELLY: Merry Christmas, Chuck.
CHUCK: Merry Christmas.
KELLY: Here. Open this on the plane. But not until New Year's Eve, midnight. Promise?
CHUCK: I promise.
PILOT: We've got some rough weather ahead. We're going to change course and avoid it.
CREW MEMBER: Buckle up back there, Chuck.
CHUCK: Okay.
CREW MEMBER: You want some more coffee?
CHUCK: No, I'm fine. Thanks.
CREW MEMBER: We've got some turbulence ahead.
CHUCK: Help! Help me! Help!
CHUCK: Hello! Hello!
CHUCK: Help! Can anybody hear me? Help! Help!
CHUCK: Hello!
CHUCK: Help me! Somebody help me!
CHUCK: Is anybody there?
CHUCK: Hello! Hello!
CHUCK: Help!
CHUCK: Wilson? Wilson? Hey.
CHUCK: I know you. Wilson.
CHUCK: Wilson. You're a volleyball.
CHUCK: Hey, Wilson. What do you think? Is that better? I think that looks better.
CHUCK: Come on. We have to go now.
CHUCK: I have made fire!
CHUCK: Yes! Yes! Look what I have created! I have made fire! Fire! Fire!
CHUCK: I have made fire!
CHUCK: What are you looking at?
CHUCK: Wilson! Wilson!
CHUCK: Hey, Wilson!
CHUCK: Don't worry, Wilson. I'll do all the paddling. You just hang on.
CHUCK: Wilson! Wilson! Wilson!
CHUCK: I'm sorry, Wilson. I'm sorry.
CHUCK: Wilson! I'm sorry! I can't! Wilson! Wilson!
CHUCK: I'm sorry, Wilson!
CHUCK: Wilson!
CHUCK: Thank you. Thank you.
CHUCK: How long have I been gone?
CREW: You've been out here a long time, sir.
CHUCK: Where am I?
CREW: You're safe now.
CHUCK: How long was I gone?
BECCA: Four years, Chuck. You were gone four years.
CHUCK: Kelly?
BECCA: She's married, Chuck.
CHUCK: She thought you were dead. Everybody did.
CHUCK: I had power over nothing. I was a slave to the island. I was trapped. And I was so alone. And I was so scared. And then one day, that logic was proven all wrong, because the tide came in and gave me a sail. And I knew I had to try.
CHUCK: That's what I keep telling myself. That I gotta keep breathing. Because tomorrow the sun will rise. Who knows what the tide could bring?
KELLY: I always knew you were alive. I knew it. Everybody said that I had to let go. They said, move on, but I always knew. I always knew you were alive.
CHUCK: You should go.
KELLY: I don't want to.
CHUCK: You have to go home.
KELLY: They'll be looking for me.
CHUCK: They will.
KELLY: I love you.
CHUCK: I love you too. But you have to go home.
KELLY: So what are you going to do now?
CHUCK: I don't know. I'll think of something.
CHUCK: I should have never gotten on that plane. I should have never gotten out of the car.
KELLY: I know.
CHUCK: But I did. And I know what I have to do now. I gotta keep breathing. Because tomorrow the sun will rise. Who knows what the tide could bring?
CHUCK: I'm Chuck Noland.
CHUCK: I was on my way to Memphis.
BETTINA: Well, you're about in the middle of nowhere.
CHUCK: I know.
BETTINA: Here, this road here, that road goes to Woodward, and that road goes to Canadian.
CHUCK: Thank you.
BETTINA: Good luck.
CHUCK: Thank you.
STAN: Welcome home, buddy.
CHUCK: Thanks, Stan.
STAN: You look great.
CHUCK: Thanks.
JERRY: Welcome back.
CHUCK: Thank you.
BECCA: Chuck! Oh my God, Chuck!
CHUCK: Becca.
BECCA: We thought you were dead!
CHUCK: Well, I wasn't.
DOCTOR: You have a dental abscess. We need to take care of that.
CHUCK: Take it out. Just take it out.
CHUCK: Where are all the packages?
WORKER: Those went out years ago.
CHUCK: What about this one?
WORKER: That one came back. Address was no good.
CHUCK: I'll deliver it.
CHUCK: I know what I have to do. I gotta keep breathing. Because tomorrow the sun will rise. Who knows what the tide could bring?
CHUCK: That package saved my life. Gave me purpose.
CHUCK: One day this package just washed up on the island, and I knew I had to deliver it. I had to keep it safe. And I did.
CHUCK: So now I've lost her again. And I'm alive. And I'm breathing in and out. And I know what I have to do.
CHUCK: I have to just keep breathing. Because tomorrow the sun will rise. And who knows what the tide could bring?
RAMON: Señor, que pasa?
CHUCK: I don't know, I'm looking for water.
CHUCK: Water. Agua.
RAMON: Ah, agua.
CHUCK: Yeah.
CHUCK: Come on. Come on!
CHUCK: I can do this.
CHUCK: Okay. Let's go. Let's do this.
CHUCK: This is it. Today is the day.
CHUCK: We live and we die by time. And we must not commit the sin of turning our backs on time.
CHUCK: You did a great job, Nikolai. Nice work.
NIKOLAI: Thank you, Chuck.
CHUCK: Every second counts. Every piece counts. That's what FedEx is about. That's what I'm about.
CHUCK: Hey Kelly.
KELLY: Hey.
CHUCK: How's your car?
KELLY: In the shop. Again.
CHUCK: Still that same transmission?
KELLY: Same one. Won't die but won't work.
CHUCK: Sounds like me.
KELLY: You look good.
CHUCK: I feel good. So you and Jack?
KELLY: Yeah. We're doing okay.
CHUCK: That's good. I'm glad. I want you to be happy.
KELLY: I want you to be happy too.
CHUCK: I am. I will be.
KELLY: Good luck, Chuck.
CHUCK: You too, Kell.
