                        In conclusion, some buildings utilize their space remarkably well — Lafayette alone hosts over 300 different courses in a single semester. That said, there are still straightforward room swaps that could improve space utilization, particularly for classes where enrollment exceeds the room's physical capacity. Overall though, room allocation is close to optimal when measured against physical capacities: only 12 classes across campus exceed theirs. This figure is drawn from roughly 46% of rooms with verified capacity data, but even if we doubled it to account for the rest, 24 overcapacity classes out of thousands would not be a significant problem. And in most if not all of these cases, an open room with more space likely exists at the same time and could accommodate a simple swap.

                        Looking at peak scheduling throughout the week, the <strong>10:50–11:40 AM</strong> block on MWF and the <strong>10:05–11:20 AM</strong> block on Tuesday/Thursday see the most individual class meetings, while overall peak room usage tends to hit around <strong>1:00 PM</strong>. Even at these busiest moments, an average of <strong>35% of rooms sit unused</strong> across the week, climbing to <strong>64% on Fridays at 10:50 AM</strong> — despite that being Friday's peak. Equally notable is the gap between max enrollment limits and physical room capacity. At peak times, there are hundreds and sometimes over a thousand empty seats in rooms that are actively in use. This suggests that occupied rooms are being underutilized, constrained by predetermined enrollment caps rather than actual space limitations. This isn't to say that enrollment limits should be raised across the board — those decisions depend on the course and the instructor — but it is worth noting as UVM continues to grow its student body without proportional expansions in housing or classroom infrastructure. Classes can feel overcrowded, and students often struggle to get into the courses they need, even when the physical space to accommodate them technically exists.

                        One broader takeaway from this project is that even a relatively simple dataset can lend itself to uses you never originally intended. While building the visualization, it occurred to me that students could use it to find an empty classroom for an hour. Maybe the library is packed, or you just want a change of scenery without having to reserve a study room. When I mentioned the project to a friend, they immediately saw a different use: they had been trying to figure out whether a room was occupied because they'd left a water bottle behind after class. That's what I find compelling about working with data. A single dataset can support interpretations and applications that go well beyond its original purpose, and as more data becomes available and accessible, that potential only grows.
